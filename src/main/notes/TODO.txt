Next Steps
    - Create structures to modify the database structure for any tables.
    - Create supertype for all classes that will be persisted (i.e. 'Persistent')
    - For non primitive member types
        - If a type of a 'Persistent' class is also 'Persistent',
            then the column should be a foreign key with that object's ID
        - Else, the Object should be converted to a JSON and saved as a String.


Ideas:
    - Members of persistent classes are by default persisted.
    - Ability to mark certain members of Persistent classes as non-persistent?
    - Methods of persistent classes are by default non persistent.
    - Ability to mark certain methods as persistent so calculated members can be included in the DB?
